## Day-to-Day Work Approach
1. Agile documentation (e.g., Trello)
1. Stand-up meeting at beginning of working time
1. Interval check-ins (ACP all working code at milestones)
  1. ACPs to be done by order of people above
1. Constant pair-programming at a minimum (2 people know what is going on with everything at any one time)
1. Stand-up meeting at end of working time (pass on what's been accomplished, help needs, what to start on next time)
1. Make sure everyone gets breaks as needed
1. Coordinate pull requests to avoid merge conflicts
1. 15-minute attempt, then ask for help
1. **Give each other encouragement**

## Conflict Plan
1. Have a third party mediator (Classmate, Instructor, TA, etc.)
  1. Each party gets to speak without being interrupted
  1. Basic respect will be shown to everyone
1. People will need to speak up, let the person know how things are being perceived
1. Talk to pair programmer if you want to attempt something on your own
  1. Get the SME to try to explain and cross-train the others (within reason)
1. Non-confrontationally ask the person who doesn't appear to be contributing if they need assistance, is something blocking their progress
1. Conflict resolution escalation will:
  1. Happen when it is clear that neither party wants to back down from their position or listen to the other person
  1. Be taken to the instructor or one of the other Code Fellows staff members

## Communication Plan
1. Hours of availability
  1. David - Class hours
  1. JJ - Anytime after 4:30pm (EST)
  1. Jacob - Anytime after 4:30pm (PST)
  1. Marni - Anytime after 6:00pm (PST)
1. Communication platforms
  1. Slack - group messages
  1. Remo
1. If collaborating, every hour take a 5 minute break.  If working individually, take any necessary breaks.  Check in with other team members every hour or two to ensure they are taking a break.
1. If falling behind, we need to re-evaluate our MVP.  Check for help needs among other members.
1. We'll communicate via Slack after hours and on weekends.
1. To ensure everyone's voice is heard, we will listen and ask at the end of a conversation if there's anything someone wants to add.
1. We will create a safe environment by being respectful, dealing with our conflicts as they emerge instead of letting them simmer.

## Work Plan
1. Task management will be handled using Trello.  The UML will be created in Miro.

## Git Process
1. A main branch, a working branch, and each feature will have a separate branch to merge into the working branch which gets merged into the main branch when the MVP is achieved.
1. The repository has been shared via making team member collaborators.
1. The Git flow will be that as soon as a feature is completed, it will be ACP'd to the working directory.
1. Yes, we will be using a PR review workflow.  It will require 2 people to review the code.  The person who merges the PR will be the person that created the PR.  There will be a merge whenever there is a completed feature.  Communicating that it is time to merge will be done via Slack.
